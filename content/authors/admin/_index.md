Welcome to my website! I am an economic sociologist, a research consultant at Smart Prosperity Institute, and a sessional lecturer at the University of Ottawa, Canada.

**Research**

My research lies at the intersection of economic sociology, organizational analysis, and inequality regimes. Currently, I conduct applied research on
the post-pandemic economic recovery in Canada, with a focus on identifying sustainable and inclusive solutions to decarbonize the economy, improve social and 
health outcomes, and increase economic performance. During my PhD, I investigated entrepreneurship building programs and the emergence of the economic category of 
‘the entrepreneur’ in Brazil. I also have experience researching climate change governance in Canada and Australia, knowledge translation and mobilization, and 
political scandals. My work has been published in anglo and lusophone peer-reviewed journals.

**Teaching**

As an educator, my teaching philosophy builds on an approach that seeks to link class discussions of sociological theories and concepts to students’ lived 
experiences. I am a firm believer in the power of data and evidence-based arguments. As such, a considerable portion of my lectures and teaching materials is 
devoted to teach data interpretation and visualization. My courses include *Local and Global Economic Relations*, *Globalization: Sociological and Anthropological 
Approaches*, *Sociology of Work and Organizations*, *Globalization and Environment*, *Economic Anthropology*, and *Contemporary Sociological Theory*.

**Passions and hobbies**

I am passionate about the statistical language programming R, open-source philosophy, and creating an inclusive and diverse knowledge community.

Want to start a conversation with me? Ask me about my favourite hobbies and life interests: motorcycles, gardening, coding in R, universal literature, indie 
movies, jazz, and dogs (especially whippets).
