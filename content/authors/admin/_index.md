Welcome to my website! I am a sociologist whose research lies at the intersection of economic sociology, organizational analysis, and inequality regimes. My most recent
research interests include an investigation of entrepreneurship building programs, and the emergence of the economic category of ‘entrepreneur’ in Brazil. I have
previously researched climate change governance in Canada and Australia, knowledge translation and mobilization, and political scandals. My work has been published in 
English and Portuguese peer-reviewed journals.

As an educator, my teaching philosophy builds on a hands-on approach to discuss theories and concepts, meaning that I continuously link class discussions to students’ 
lived experiences. I am a firm believer in the power of data and evidence-based discussions to make abstract reasoning grounded in reality. My courses include *Local and
Global Economic Relations*, *Globalization: Sociological and Anthropological approaches*, *Sociology or work and organizations*, *Globalization and Environment*, *Economic
Anthropology*, and *Contemporary Sociological Theory*.

I am passionate about the statistical language programming R, reproducible research, open-source philosophy, and inclusive knowledge community.

Want to start a conversation with me? Ask me about my favourite hobbies: motorcycles, gardening, coding in R, independent movies, and walking dogs (especially whippets).
