Welcome to my website! I am a sociologist whose research lies at the intersection of economic sociology, organizational analysis, and inequality regimes. Recently, I've
studied entrepreneurship building programs and the emergence of the economic category of ‘the entrepreneur’ in Brazil. I also have experience researching climate change
governance in Canada and Australia, knowledge translation and mobilization, and political scandals. My work has been published in English and Portuguese language peer-
reviewed journals.

As an educator, my teaching philosophy builds on an approach that seeks to link class discussions of sociological theories and concepts to students’ lived experiences. I
am a firm believer in the power of data and evidence-based arguments. As such, a considerable portion of my lectures and teaching materials is devoted to teach data
interpretation and visualization. My courses include *Local and Global Economic Relations*, *Globalization: Sociological and Anthropological Approaches*, *Sociology of
Work and Organizations*, *Globalization and Environment*, *Economic Anthropology*, and *Contemporary Sociological Theory*.

I am passionate about the statistical language programming R, reproducible research, open-source philosophy, and inclusive knowledge community.

Want to start a conversation with me? Ask me about my favourite hobbies: motorcycles, gardening, coding in R, universal literature, independent movies, and walking dogs (especially whippets).
