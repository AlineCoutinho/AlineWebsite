abstract = "Press is frequently accused of being 'incendiary', nourishing political crisis in an irresponsible way, in search of better headlines. This article
relies on an analysis of editorials of the three leading Brazilian newspapers to observe another facet: how the crisis is constituted as a 'deviation' 
something to be corrected by punishment or exclusion of certain actors and kinds of behavior. Thus, the foundations of the political system are never put in 
question."
