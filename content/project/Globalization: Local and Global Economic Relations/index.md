What exactly is globalization? A process? An ideology? A historical moment? Does globalization even exist? If so, when did it start? There are no consensual answers to these questions. The answers cater to the flavor of the writer: each providing a definition and emphasizing a different aspect of social reality. However, it is undeniable that the 20th century, at least in the West, have witnessed increasing flows of peoples, commodities, culture, beliefs, and capital across national borders - some elements flowing easier than others, for sure. This course is designed to introduce students to important and contemporary issues related to these global flows. It touches on the most relevant theoretical approaches and conceptual tools used by both sociologists and anthropologists when trying to make sense of diverse global phenomena. 

In my lectures, we consider the existence, scale, unevenness, and intensity of an array of global flows and structures. We discuss a wide assortment of global processes, its contradictions and ambiguities as well as different resistance movements and alternatives to globalization. We also explore some positive and perverse outcomes of many global activities in an attempt to improve our critical thinking regarding globalization.

With the changes that Western societies have witnessed in the past couple of years (most specifically the increasing concerns about migration, the Brexit referendum, Trumpâ€™s travel bans, and trade wars), we also engage in discussions of whether we have entered a new era: one of *degloblalization*.

In addition, we assess some of the presumed changes that political and socioeconomic structures such as nation-states, financial markets, and global value chains have recently faced. The discussions include topics such as the features of global terrorism and international organized crime, patterns of global gender-based division of labor, the transnational production, distribution and consumption of commodities, international migration, and the reality and characteristics of a global culture. 

At the end of the course, students should be able to:
1) Identify the main currents of thought and topics withing globalization studies.
2) Apply sociological and anthropological concepts, theories and methodological tools to the study of different global phenomena. 
3) Become acquainted with several sites of contestation and formulate evidence-based opinions on different dimensions of globalization.
4) Critically identify some of the socioeconomic and environmental effects of globalization.

In sum, students should be able to make sense of current global flows and to critically assess information thereof provided by media, academic work, and other 
channels.
