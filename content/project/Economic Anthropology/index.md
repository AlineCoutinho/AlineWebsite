Economic anthropologists are mainly concerned with understanding how economic activities intersect with cultural, political, social and institutional processes. While challenging orthodox assumptions about economic rationality, we discuss the embeddedness of the economy in culture. 

In our course we peruse through classic and recent debates in economic anthropology with the aim of developing critical reading and writing skills. 

The course is designed to provide students with an overview of the most relevant theoretical approaches and conceptual tools used in economic anthropology to analyze hunting, gathering, pastoral, and gift economies, as well as market capitalism.

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

1) Assess the cultural, structural and political dimensions of the economy;
2) Identify the main debates and differentiate between relevant currents of thought in economic anthropology;
3) Make sense of economic phenomena with reference to ethnographic and theoretical material.
