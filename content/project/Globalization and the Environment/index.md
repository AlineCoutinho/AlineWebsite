Earlier discussions about globalization tended to ignore the environment despite the fact that one of the most pressing issues of our contemporary era involves the human impact on the environment and its accelerating degradation. Much has changed with the rise of environmental movements in late 1980s and 1990s, and the increasing awareness of the consequences of our extractive, productive, and consumption practices on the environment. In this course, we will discuss recent scholarship that illuminates the ecological dimension of globalization from a sociological perspective.

Our attention will be placed on several topics such as food systems, water management, loss of biodiversity, patterns of consumption, and climate change in an effort to unpack the complex relationship between global flows and the environment. 

We will also discuss cultural ideas about the environment and extractive resource industries, major institutional actors that impact the governance of resources and ecosystems, the role of traditional and expert knowledge that orient our relationship with the environment and our drive to find solutions to environmental crisis. 

At the end of the course, students should be able to:
1) Identify and apply the main concepts, theories and methodological tools that sociologists use to study issues of globalization and the environment.
2) Identify global social and power dynamics that impact the environment.
3) Understand how environmental problems are of global concern.
4) Think critically about the relationship between globalization and the environment in the anthropocene.
