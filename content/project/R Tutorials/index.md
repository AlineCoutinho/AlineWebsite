These tutorials were designed as complementary materials for my courses in Sociology. They include information about R and RStudio installation, libraries and packages, and entry-
level principles and procedures of data summary, analysis and visualization. The learning outcomes of these turotials are:

 - Being ablt to set R and RStudio in a desktop; 
 - To understand basic R syntax;
 - To become familiar with the principles of tidy data;
 - To improve skills in data visualization and data interpretation;
 - To be able to produce R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint) in the form of customizable reports.
