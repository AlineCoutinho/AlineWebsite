These tutorials were designed as complementary materials for my courses in Sociology. They include information about R and RStudio installation, libraries and packages, and entry-
level principles and procedures of data summary, analysis and visualization. The goals of these turotials are:

 - To help students set R and RStudio in their desktops; 
 - To explain basic R syntax;
 - To initiate students with data wrangling;
 - To improve skills in data visualization and data interpretation;
 - To learn how to produce R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint) in the form of customizable reports.
