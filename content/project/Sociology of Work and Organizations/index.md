“Do we work to live or do we live to work?” A question like this illustrates the centrality and importance of work in the lives of most of us.  In this course, we will study some of the structural forces that shape the workplace and the labour market.

The course will focus on the contemporary Canadian workplace and its social dynamics in the context of broader patterns and social structures. We will investigate and discuss a number of social processes related to work and within organizations through a critical perspective. Although the course draws from recent scholarship, students will soon realize that the world of work is constantly changing precisely because of the multiple social forces in contention. As such, in this course, we will investigate a myriad of competing interests and power dynamics between different actors and coalitions that shape work organization, labour rights, precarity and insecurity, opportunity-hoarding in the workplace, and so many other aspects of the work life.

People experience work life demands differently. As such, we will also draw attention to the inequalities (re)produced in organizations and present in the labour market. We will discuss aspects of labour force participation, discrimination, racism in the job market, as well as other structural barriers that visible minorities and persons with disabilities encounter to access employment. 

Later in the course, we will shift attention to workers movements and unions in Canada. We will discuss the socioeconomic impacts of organized labour both historically and in contemporary terms. We will also critically evaluate the power of unions in a globalized era, and the role of collective bargains in a deindustrialized economy. 

Finally, throughout the course, we will unpack recent developments in light of the coronavirus pandemic. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the labour market and impacted the lives of different segments of society? 

The course is designed to introduce students to concepts and theories in the sociology of work and organizations. The idea is to develop a broader understanding of forces and structures that impact our work lives in Canada. However, a small part of the course is dedicated to studying work and organizations abroad.

At the end of the course, students should be able to:
1) Identify the main concepts that sociologists use to study work and organizations.
2) Apply sociological concepts, theories and methodological tools to the study of work and organizations in Canada and abroad. 
3) Understand key patterns of Canadian workplace and workforce.
4) Identify social and power dynamics within the Canadian labour market, firms, and unions.
5) Collect and interpret official data regarding labour.
6) Think critically about the pandemic impacts on work.

In sum, students should be able to make sense of the workplace and organized labour in Canada, and assess information thereof provided by media, social scientists and other channels.
